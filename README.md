# Solidity Contracts Lab

A curated laboratory for experimenting with Solidity smart contracts and tests.

This repository focuses on **clear contract implementations**, **solid testing practices**, and **hands-on exploration** of common patterns in the EVM ecosystem.

This project is **not** intended to be a production-ready library.

## Goals

- Provide minimal and readable Solidity contracts
- Demonstrate idiomatic testing patterns
- Serve as a playground for exploring EVM behavior
- Enable comparison between different implementation approaches

## Philosophy

* Prefer simplicity over abstraction
* Make behavior explicit, not implicit
* Readability over cleverness
